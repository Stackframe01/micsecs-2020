                In addition to oral paper presentations, <strong>MICSECS 2020</strong>
                encourages Student Colloquium and Poster &amp; Demo session.
            </p>



            <h2 id="poster-presentations-and-demo">Postrer &amp; Demo session</h2>

            <p>
                The <strong>Poster &amp; Demo session</strong> is dedicated to
                demonstrate how the results of participant researchers work.
                Besides posters, the participants should present their
                executable models and devices they have obtained during their
                work.
            </p>

            <p>
                Posters &amp; Demos form an opportunity to informally present your
                research approach at the conference. It is great to discuss your
                research in free form with all attendants of the session. Many
                people will be stopping by your poster, and you will have a chance
                to talk to them, explain what you are doing, and get feedback. Of
                course, the number of people who will stop depends on how well you
                design your poster!
            </p>



            <h2 id="student-colloquium">Student Colloquium</h2>

            <p>
                The <strong>Student Colloquium</strong> is dedicated to
                demonstrate work in progress projects of master's, bachelor's,
                and Ph.D. students focused more on practical and applied tasks,
                including their "pet" projects. It allows our participants to
                start networking in the early stages of their projects and career.
                We offer a short pitch session to present their project and take
                quick feedback on it (around 5 minutes for each).
            </p>

            <p>
                The best student and poster presentation will get an award!
