            Computer Systems (MICSECS 2020) is an international event dedicated
            to discussing research results and directions related to Computer
            Systems and Networks, Cyber-Physical Systems, Computer
            Security, Multimedia technologies, and AR/VR/MR technologies.
        </p>

        <p>
            Conference languages: English and Russian.

            The conference gives under- and post-graduate students a possibility
            to exchange their experience and results in perspective research and
            development of computer systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            All authors will be required to pre-submit abstracts of their
            papers. All submissions will be carefully reviewed by the program

        <p>
            In addition to oral paper presentations, <strong>MICSECS 2020</strong>
            encourages Student colloquium. <!-- and poster presentation with and Demo session. -->
        </p>

        <p>
            The <strong>Student colloquium</strong> is dedicated to demonstrate
            work in progress projects of master's, bachelor's, and Ph.D.
            students focused more on practical and applied tasks, including
            their "pet" projects. It allows our participants to start networking in the
            early stages of their projects and career.
        </p>

        <!-- <p>
             The <strong>Demo session</strong> is dedicated to demonstrate how
             the results of participant researchers work. Besides posters, the
             participants should present their executable models and devices they
             have obtained during their work.
             </p>

             <p>
             Posters &amp; Demos form an opportunity to informally present your
             research approach at the conference. It is great to discuss your
             research in free form with all attendants of the session. Many
             people will be stopping by your poster, and you will have a chance
             to talk to them, explain what you are doing, and get feedback. Of
             course, the number of people who will stop depends on how well you
             design your poster!
             </p> -->

        <p>
            The best student <!-- and poster --> presentation will get an award!
