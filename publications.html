                       target="_blank">Latex template</a>

                    but this is not recommended).
                </li>
                <li>

                    all the words (except for articles, conjunctions, and
                    prepositions) will be capital letters, which means the Title

                <li>Remove the line that indicated the oral or poster presentation.</li>
                <!-- <li>
                     Increase the article size to <strong>8 pages</strong> (for
                     authors who made short presentations) and
                     <strong>12 pages</strong> (for authors who made long
                     presentations) by adding new information.

                    Check that the article is of high quality and worth
                    publishing. The article should reflect the significance,
                    technical soundness, novelty, relevance, and, if applicable,
                    the sufficiency of information to permit replication.

                    It is necessary to write a brief abstract, designed for a wide
                    range of readers, in the volume of about 200-250 words to state
                    the scientific content of the article: the subject, the purpose
                    of the work, the method or methodology of the work, the brief
                    description of the experiment, the results, the recommendations

                <li>
                    Each article will be re-reviewed. If the above requirements are
                    not met, a submission for publication in the CEUR Workshop
                    Proceedings may be rejected.
